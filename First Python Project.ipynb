Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data
Description
Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this assignment, you will extract some stock data, you will then display this data in a graph.

In Python, you can ignore warnings using the warnings module. You can use the filterwarnings function to filter or ignore specific warning messages or categories.

import warnings
# Ignore all warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=FutureWarning)
Define Graphing Function
In this section, we define the function make_graph. You don't have to know how the function works, you should only care about the inputs. It takes a dataframe with stock data (dataframe must contain Date and Close columns), a dataframe with revenue data (dataframe must contain Date and Revenue columns), and the name of the stock.

def make_graph(stock_data, revenue_data, stock):
    fig = make_subplots(rows=2, cols=1, shared_xaxes=True, subplot_titles=("Historical Share Price", "Historical Revenue"), vertical_spacing = .3)
    stock_data_specific = stock_data[stock_data.Date <= '2021--06-14']
    revenue_data_specific = revenue_data[revenue_data.Date <= '2021-04-30']
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=pd.to_datetime(stock_data_specific.Date, infer_datetime_format=True), y=stock_data_specific.Close.astype("float"), name="Share Price"), row=1, col=1)
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=pd.to_datetime(revenue_data_specific.Date, infer_datetime_format=True), y=revenue_data_specific.Revenue.astype("float"), name="Revenue"), row=2, col=1)
    fig.update_xaxes(title_text="Date", row=1, col=1)
    fig.update_xaxes(title_text="Date", row=2, col=1)
    fig.update_yaxes(title_text="Price ($US)", row=1, col=1)
    fig.update_yaxes(title_text="Revenue ($US Millions)", row=2, col=1)
    fig.update_layout(showlegend=False,
    height=900,
    title=stock,
    xaxis_rangeslider_visible=True)
    fig.show()
Question 1: Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data
Using the Ticker function enter the ticker symbol of the stock we want to extract data on to create a ticker object. The stock is Tesla and its ticker symbol is TSLA.

Using the ticker object and the function history extract stock information and save it in a dataframe named tesla_data. Set the period parameter to max so we get information for the maximum amount of time.

Reset the index using the reset_index(inplace=True) function on the tesla_data DataFrame and display the first five rows of the tesla_data dataframe using the head function. Take a screenshot of the results and code from the beginning of Question 1 to the results below.

Question 2: Use Webscraping to Extract Tesla Revenue Data
Use the requests library to download the webpage https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/revenue.htm Save the text of the response as a variable named html_data.

Parse the html data using beautiful_soup.

Using BeautifulSoup or the read_html function extract the table with Tesla Revenue and store it into a dataframe named tesla_revenue. The dataframe should have columns Date and Revenue.

Execute the following line to remove the comma and dollar sign from the Revenue column.

tesla_revenue["Revenue"] = tesla_revenue['Revenue'].str.replace(',|\$',"")
Execute the following lines to remove an null or empty strings in the Revenue column.

tesla_revenue.dropna(inplace=True)

tesla_revenue = tesla_revenue[tesla_revenue['Revenue'] != ""]
Display the last 5 row of the tesla_revenue dataframe using the tail function. Take a screenshot of the results.

Question 3: Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data
Using the Ticker function enter the ticker symbol of the stock we want to extract data on to create a ticker object. The stock is GameStop and its ticker symbol is GME.

Using the ticker object and the function history extract stock information and save it in a dataframe named gme_data. Set the period parameter to max so we get information for the maximum amount of time.

Reset the index using the reset_index(inplace=True) function on the gme_data DataFrame and display the first five rows of the gme_data dataframe using the head function. Take a screenshot of the results and code from the beginning of Question 3 to the results below.

Question 4: Use Webscraping to Extract GME Revenue Data
Use the requests library to download the webpage https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/stock.html. Save the text of the response as a variable named html_data.

Parse the html data using beautiful_soup.

Using BeautifulSoup or the read_html function extract the table with GameStop Revenue and store it into a dataframe named gme_revenue. The dataframe should have columns Date and Revenue. Make sure the comma and dollar sign is removed from the Revenue column using a method similar to what you did in Question 2.

Display the last five rows of the gme_revenue dataframe using the tail function. Take a screenshot of the results.

Question 5: Plot Tesla Stock Graph
Use the make_graph function to graph the Tesla Stock Data, also provide a title for the graph. The structure to call the make_graph function is make_graph(tesla_data, tesla_revenue, 'Tesla'). Note the graph will only show data upto June 2021.

Question 6: Plot GameStop Stock Graph
Use the make_graph function to graph the GameStop Stock Data, also provide a title for the graph. The structure to call the make_graph function is make_graph(gme_data, gme_revenue, 'GameStop'). Note the graph will only show data upto June 2021.
